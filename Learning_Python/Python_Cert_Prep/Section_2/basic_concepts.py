# Octal Numbers

# its part of the exam but not widely used
# when number starts with 0O or 0o then thats octal value
# can use 0 to 7
print(0o123)


# hexadecimal numbers
print(0x123)

# Operators
### Can't divide by 0 #
division = 5 / 7
plus = 4 + 4
subtraction = 5 - 2
multiplication = 5 * 5


# integer division
int_num = 7 // 2
print(int_num)

# modulus division
left_over_num = 7 % 4
print(left_over_num)

# power operator

power_sum = 2 ** 3
print(power_sum)

# Float
float_sum = 2 + 3.0
print(float_sum)


# Reassigning Values ###
age = 22
print(age)
age = age + 5
print(age)

# shortcut ^
age = 22
age += 5  # also works with "-, *, /, +"
print(age)

# string things
string = "hokus" + "pokus"
print(string)

string = "hokus"
print(string * 5)


# string concatenation
print('23' + '3')

# input function

print("What is your name?")
user_name = input()  # input function always returns str
print('Hello there ' + user_name)

user_name = input("What is your name?: ")
print('Hello there ' + user_name)
